## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Naming Conventions

- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  ```cpp
  const int MIDI_VELOCITY = 127;
  #define MAX_KEYS 32
  ```

- **Variables**: Use camelCase
  ```cpp
  int keyPressed = 0;
  boolean messageSent = false;
  ```

- **Functions**: Use camelCase with descriptive names
  ```cpp
  void initializeColumnPins() { }
  int getMidiNote(int row, int col) { }
  ```

- **Arrays**: Use camelCase with descriptive names
  ```cpp
  int keyValues[NUM_ROWS][NUM_COLS];
  boolean keyPressed[NUM_ROWS][NUM_COLS];
  ```

#### Formatting

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Braces**: Opening brace on same line
  ```cpp
  if (condition) {
    // code
  }
  ```

- **Line length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when possible

#### Comments

- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Use `/* */` for multi-line comments
- Add function documentation:
  ```cpp
  /**
   * Calculate MIDI note number for a given matrix position
   * @param row Row index (0-3)
   * @param col Column index (0-7)
   * @return MIDI note number
   */
  int getMidiNote(int row, int col) {
    return STARTING_MIDI_NOTE + (row * NUM_COLS) + col + 1;
  }
  ```

### Arduino-Specific Guidelines

- **Avoid using `String`**: Use char arrays for memory efficiency
- **Minimize global variables**: Use local variables when possible
- **Use `const` and `#define`**: For values that don't change
- **Avoid `delay()`**: Use `millis()` for timing when possible
- **Check array bounds**: Prevent buffer overflows

### Testing

Before submitting code:

1. **Compile without errors** on Arduino IDE
2. **Test on actual hardware** if possible
3. **Verify MIDI output** works correctly
4. **Check memory usage**: Use Arduino IDE memory report
5. **Run example sketches** to ensure compatibility

### Documentation

When adding features:

1. **Update README.md** with new functionality
2. **Update config.h** if adding configuration options
3. **Add comments** explaining complex logic
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
5. **Create examples** if adding major features

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Make your changes** in your feature branch

3. **Test thoroughly** (see Testing section above)

4. **Commit your changes** with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add velocity sensitivity feature"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Describe what changes you made and why
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots/videos if relevant

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

**Good examples:**
```
Add velocity sensitivity based on press speed
Fix key ghosting issue in matrix scanning
Update wiring diagram with diode placement
Optimize loop performance by 30%
```

**Bad examples:**
```
Update file
Fix bug
Changes
asdf
```
